<h2>Data</h2>

This directory contains the .dat files for the SEDs presented in <b>R. E. Ainsworth</b>, A. M. M. Scaife, D. A. Green, C. P. Coughlan and T. P. Ray, “GMRT detections of low mass young stars at 323 and 608 MHz”, <i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</i>, 459, 1248–1258, 2016 (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.459.1248A">ads</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06836">arXiv</a>).

The .dat files comprise three columns: frequency (in GHz), flux density (in Jy) and error on the flux density (in Jy).

The SED data ranges from centimetre to IR wavelengths for the following protostellar systems (frequencies < 3 THz), descriptions of which can be found in Section 4.1 of the paper:
<li> L1551 IRS 5
<li> T Tau
<li> DG Tau

The SEDs were fitted following the methods described in Section 4.2 of the paper and the resulting plots can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/rainsworth/Spectral-Energy-Distributions/tree/master/2016MNRAS.459.1248A/plots">2016MNRAS.459.1248A/plots</a> directory.
